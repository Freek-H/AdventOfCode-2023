# Advent of Code 2023

## Introduction
Advent of Code (AOC) is a yearly event hosted at https://adventofcode.com.

This repository contains my solutions for the puzzles posted for the year 2023.

## How to run
You will Python 3 installed. The lowest version I've tested the code with is 3.7 and any newer versions should work just fine. If I use features from a newer version I will hopefully remmeber to change this text.

Right now I'm only using standard library code and as such there is no installation of packages required. If that changes I will add those two `requirements.txt` and hopefully remember to change this text.

## Planned scope
- Both problems from each day.
- Updating the README as required.
